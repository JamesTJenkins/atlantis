What is CSV for:
These go to a corresponding string table asset in the project when you update a csv you will have to update its associated string table asset manually (Hopefully for now see dev note).

These are currently just used for text dialog such as the comms widget in the prologue but may be expanded upon more later.

Dev note:
There is probably better ways to do this to have it auto update but still be functional with github but this will do for now.
